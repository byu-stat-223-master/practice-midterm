## Winnebago (65 points)
You visit Alabama to attend the Alabama vs LSU football game. The football game
kicks off at 2:30pm and your flight departs from the Atlanta airport at 9:30pm.
You're trying to figure out what time you should leave and head to the airport.
The length of the game in minutes is defined by a normal distribution with a
mean of 180 and a standard deviation of 15. If you choose to leave the game
early, you leave 15 minutes before the end of the game. There are 3 different
routes you can possibly take to the airport. Each route is defined by the
following parameters:

Route 1 (freeway):
This route is a few miles longer than the other routes, but it's almost all
freeway driving. If there is no traffic, this route takes 3 hours exactly. If
you leave before the game is over, the number of minutes added by traffic is
defined by an exponential distribution with a lambda (rate) parameter of 1. If
you leave after the game ends, the number of minutes added by traffic is defined
by an exponential distribution with a lambda (rate) parameter of .05.

Route 2 (backroads):
This route avoids freeways and rarely experiences traffic delays. However, the
average speed limit on this route is lower than the freeway. If there are no
delays, this route takes 3 hours and 15 minutes. However, there are 23 traffic
signals along this route. There is an 15% chance of getting stopped at each
light and, if you are stopped, the waiting time at the light (in minutes) is
defined by a normal distribution with a mean of 2 and a standard deviation of
0.3.
Since this route involves several winding, back country roads that are a single
lane, there is a risk of getting stuck behind weekend travelers out in their
Winnebago. The likelihood of getting stuck behind such a vehicle is 15%. If you
get stuck behind a Winnebago, the route takes 30 minutes longer.

Route 3 (combination):
This route is a combination of freeway and back roads. With no delays, this
route  takes 3 hours and 10 minutes. If you take this route before the game is
over, the traffic delay is defined by an exponential distribution with a lambda
(rate) parameter of 3. If you leave after the game is over, the traffic delay is
defined by an exponential distribution with a lambda (rate) parameter of 0.3.
There are only 10 traffic signals on this route, and the parameters related to
the traffic signals are the same as Route 2. There's also a 15% chance of
getting stuck behind a Winnebago, which would add 20 minutes to the route.

You anticipate a long security line at the airport. If you don't arrive at the
airport at least an hour before the flight, you will miss the flight.

Helpful hints:

* The `rnorm` function can be used to generate random values from a normal
distribution with a given `mean` and `sd`
* The `rexp` function can be used to generate random values from an exponential
distribution with a given `rate`

1. (35 points) Define a function called `winnebago` that simulates a single
scenario. This function should take a single logical argument, `leave`, which
indicates whether or not you leave the game early. This function should evaluate
each route and return two pieces of information (you can decide how you want to
return this information):
  1. The name of the route that was the fastest
  2. A logical value indicating whether you made it to the airport in time for
  your flight using the fastest route
2. (10 points) Using the function defined in step 1, run this simulation 10,000
times for both scenarios (leaving early and staying the whole game) and store
the results
3. (10 points) Using the results from step 2, estimate the likelihood that you
will make your flight under both scenarios (leaving early and staying the whole
game)
4. (5 points) Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the two estimates
calculated in step 3.
5. (5 points) Based on your simulation, should I plan to leave the game early or
stay the entire game? Which route is the best route to get me to the airport on
time?


## Tickets (40 points)
There is a box with a collection of 4 different types of tickets (red, blue,
green, and yellow). Each ticket allows you to play different carnival games.
Suppose you are only interested in playing games supported by red tickets.

The probabilities of obtaining a red, blue, green, and yellow ticket are
respectively 0.12, 0.25, 0.38, 0.26 and the box has so many tickets that the
probabilities are unaffected as tickets are withdrawn.

You can purchase a random draw of 3 tickets for $2.50. You decide to keep
purchasing draws until you collect 5 red tickets.

1. (25 points) Define a function called `tickets`  that simulates a single
scenario of purchasing random draws of 3 tickets until you have collected 5 red
tickets. This function should return the amount of money you spent to obtain 5
red tickets.
2. (5 points) Using the function defined in 1, run this simulation 10,000 times
and store the results.
3. (5 points) Using the results from step 2, estimate the amount of money you
would need to spend in order to obtain 5 red tickets.
4. (5 points) Calculate a 95% confidence interval on the estimate from the
previous step.
