## Drips (60 points)

You notice that the sink in your bathroom has an annoying drip. The number of drips
every minute is random. Specifically, suppose that the number of drips in a minute
is initially a Poisson random variable with a rate parameter `rate`. (You don't 
need to know anything about the Poisson distribution except that you can sample 
a random value from the Poisson distribution with parameter `rate` in R with the
code: `rpois(1, rate)`.) Unfortunately, the severity of the leak is increasing.  
Specifically, with each passing minute, the rate parameter increases by x%, where 
x is a random value from the uniform distribution on the interval 0 to 5.  (Note 
that the value of x changes every minute!)  You can sample a random value from 
this uniform distribution using `runif(1,0,5)`.

Write a function called `drip` that takes 2 parameters: `rate` and `minutes`. 
`rate` is the initial poisson rate parameter of the drips. `minutes` is the number
of minutes the sink is dripping. This function should return the total number of
drips in the provided `minutes`. (15 points)

Using the `drips` function you just defined, perform a simulation with 10,000 
repetitions with an initial `rate` of 1 for 120 `minutes` (2 hours). Assign the 
results of your simulation into a vector called `drip_counts`. At the end of this
step, the `drip_counts` vector should contain 10,000 values, each representing 
the total number of drips after 2 hours with an initial `rate` parameter of 1. 
(10 points)

Using the `drip_counts` vector, calculate the probability that the total number 
of drips exceeds 700 after 2 hours. *Make sure you assess and report your Monte 
Carlo (simulation) error (build a confidence interval).* (20 points)

Suppose you are interested in testing the null hypothesis that the initial rate
parameter is 1 versus the alternative hypothesis that the initial rate is larger
than 1.  You observe 876 drips in 2 hours.  What is the associated p-value? *Again
make sure that you assess and report your Monte Carlo (simulation) error.* (10 
points)

Using a 0.05 level of significance, what conclusion do you make regarding the
null hypothesis? (5 points)

## March Madness (45 points)
The NCAA tournament (fondly referred to as March Madness) is a collegiate basketball
tournament that takes place every spring. The tournament is made up of 64 teams 
who play a single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion. The
tournament is divided into 4 regions of 16 teams, and teams are ranked 1 - 16 in
each region.

In the first round of the tournament, each number 1 ranked team plays the number
16 ranked team in their region (So there are 4 games played between 1 and 16 seeded 
teams). This year, For the first time ever, a 16 ranked team actually beat
a number 1 ranked team. The victory brings the historical win-loss record for 16 
seeds vs. 1 seeds to 1-135. Even though this had never previously occurred, odds 
makers had calculated the likelihood of this event to be 1:54.

Write a function called `tournament` that takes 1 parameter: `odds`. `odds` represents
the likelihood of a 16 seed beating a 1 seed. This function should return the number
of years (tournaments) that it takes before a 16 seed beats a 1 seed. (15 points)

Using the `tournament` function defined above, perform a simulation with 10,000 
repetitions with the historical odds ratio (1/136). Assign the results of your 
simulation into a vector called `historical_odds`. At the end of this step, the
`historical_odds` vector should contain 10,000 values, each representing the number
of years until a 16 seed beats a 1 seed given the historical odds ratio. (10 points)

Using the `tournament` function defined above, perform a simulation with 10,000 
repetitions with the calculated odds ratio (1/54). Assign the results of your 
simulation into a vector called `calculated_odds`. At the end of this step, the
`calculated_odds` vector should contain 10,000 values, each representing the number
of years until a 16 seed beats a 1 seed given the calculated odds ratio. (10 points)

Calculate the estimate for the number of years until a 16 seed beats a 1 seed for
both the `historical_odds` and `calculated_odds` vectors. *Make sure that you 
assess and report your Monte Carlo (simulation) error for each estimate*. (10 points)
